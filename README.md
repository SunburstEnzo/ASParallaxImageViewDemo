#ASParallaxImageView (Objective-C Framework)

![Preview in the demo app](/ParallaxGif.gif)

Like that parallax effect on App Icons on tvOS?

Here's the iOS version! For UIImageViews, replace with this subclass.

Make sure userInteraction is enabled.

Make sure there's adequate room on the z axis otherwise it will clip with whatever's behind it, so set the customZPosition to something high (h/t @AdamSwinden)

If you have any problems let me know @SunburstEnzo
